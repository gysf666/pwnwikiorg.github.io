    QCubed SQL Injection
    ==================

    | Identifier: | AIT-SA-20210215-02 |
    | Target: | QCubed Framework |
    | Vendor: | QCubed |
    | Version: | all versions including 3.1.1 |
    | CVE: | CVE-2020-24913 |
    | Accessibility: | Remote |
    | Severity: | Critical |
    | Author: | Wolfgang Hotwagner (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology) |

    SUMMARY
    =======
    QCubed is a PHP Model-View-Controller Rappid Application Development framework. (https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed)

    VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
    =========================
    A SQL injection vulnerability in qcubed (all versions including 3.1.1)  in profile.php via the strQuery parameter allows an unauthenticated  attacker to access the database by injecting SQL code via a crafted POST  request.  The strQuery parameter of the serialized array in profile.php  could lead to a sql-injection. This parameter is used by the  PrintExplainStatement which simply concats "EXPLAIN ." with this  parameter:

    public function ExplainStatement($sql) {
         return $this->Query("EXPLAIN " . $sql);
    }


    This query will be executed unfiltered.

    We were able to write proof-of concept exploit for mysql and postgres.  Unfortunately with mysql we were not able to use a  stacked-queries-payload and we had to exploit this vulnerability with a  timebased approach.


    VULNERABLE VERSIONS
    ===================
    All versions including 3.1.1 are affected.


    TESTED VERSIONS
    ===============
    QCubed 3.1.1

    IMPACT
    ======
    An unauthenticated attacker could  access the database remotely. In  worst case scenarios an attacker might be able to execute code on the  remote machine

    MITIGATION
    ==========

    A patch was delivered by QCubed that allows to disable the profile-functionality( https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed/pull/1320/files ).
