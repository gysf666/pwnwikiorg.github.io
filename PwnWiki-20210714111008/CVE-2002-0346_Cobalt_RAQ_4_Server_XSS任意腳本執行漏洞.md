    ----=[Brief Description]=------------

    The Sun Cobalt RaQ is a server appliance for Internet Service Providers
    (ISPs).
    It can host up to 200 individual websites or it can be dedicated to a
    single medium or large customer. This versatility opens up tremendous
    opportunity for service provider to invest in a single piece of hardware
    while migrating business customers up to dedicated servers.

    Cobalt's service.cgi incorrectly handles the incoming search parses,
    incoming HTML tags or JavaScript will be included inside the result without
    them being filtered out for dangerous content. A similar problem occurs with
    the x.cgi's inclusion of malicious code inside the resulting title search.

    The cgi^s files is an open source .A security vulnerability in the
    product allows attackers to insert malicious content into existing web pages by
    exploiting the Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability.
