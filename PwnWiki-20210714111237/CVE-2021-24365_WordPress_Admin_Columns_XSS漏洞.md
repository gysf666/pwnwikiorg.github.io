WordPress Admin Columns plugin versions below 5.5.2 Pro and 4.3.2 Pro suffers from a cross site scripting vulnerability.

XSS
---

    Proof of Concept (PoC):

    1. Create a custom field for WordPress users which allows storing HTML
        control characters. This can be done, e.g., with the "Advanced Custom
        Fields" plug-in [2].

    2. Store "<img src=0 onerror=alert()>" in the custom field for any user.

    3. Open the Admin Columns plug-in settings.

    4. Choose the "Admin Columns" tab and select "Users" from the drop-down
        menu.

    5. Click "Add Column", choose the type "Custom Field" and select the
        previously created custom field.

    6. Open the user list in the WordPress back end. The JavaScript code
        will be executed.
